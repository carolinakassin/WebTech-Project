   <br>     Piazza Duomo, Alba <br>
        
        “Inventive, artistic Italian dishes matched with superb wines in truffle country,” is how The World’s 50 Best Restaurants, which are considered the Oscars of fine dining, sums up what Piazza Duomo is about. Helmed by Enrico Crippa, who trained with legendary Italian chef Gualtiero Marchesi, Piazza Duomo is located in Alba, in the heart of the Langhe area of Piedmont, famous for wines and truffles.
        
        Here’s what to expect according to The World’s 50 Best: “A taste of Piedmont, one of the finest food and wine regions of the world, through the sharply focused culinary lens of Enrico Crippa, now firmly established as among Italy’s most creative chefs. Diners can select from the à la carte options, or choose from three tasting menus, one of which focuses specifically on the local Langhe region, while the others are more wide-ranging (while still distinctively Italian). During white truffle season, tables are at even more of a premium than usual.”
