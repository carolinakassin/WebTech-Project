<H2>Camila</H2>
<p>I was born in Argentina, in 1996 until I turned 15 the only thing I would eat <br>
was pizza, pasta and chocolates. <br>
Today, my favorite food is truffled rissoto, or everything that has truffle!
<br> I can't stop regretting all the years I missed trying new things! So my main goal is to make people try new and delicious things </p>
<h2>Carolina</h2>
<p>I was also born in Argentina. Differently from my sister, I had always loved eating <br>
I eat sushi since I was five years old! And can't be more proud of my extra kg! <BR>
Eat, Eat, REPEAT!</p>
