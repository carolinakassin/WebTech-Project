    <h1>Project Proposal</h1>
    <h3>What is your website about?</h3>
    <p>My website is about "Eat is my Religion", my foodie instagram account 
        which I would like to transform into a blog. Eat is my Religion is a 
        page where you can find restaurants from all over the world and therefore, 
        find the different dishes that the restaurants have to offer and the best options to order.
    </p>
    <h3>What is the objective of your website?</h3>
    <p>The objective of my website is to have different sections for the different
        types of food: italian, japanese, american. Then, after selecting the type of 
        food you want, you can select the country you are interested in.
        The main objective is to guide people on the different gastronomic offers from 
        the different countries around the world.

    </p>
    <h3> Who is your target audience set?</h3>
    <p>My target audience are people from 15 to 60 years old. Mainly, everyperson 
        who knows how to use instagram and the internet. People who like to
        go out to eat are my main audience set.


    </p>
    <h3>What content do you plan to include in each page of your website?</h3>

    <p>I plan to include a section on the menu of each restaurant; pictures of the 
        dishes; and comments on the restaurant service and food. I would additionally
        add some information of the city and some of the attractions that you can do as a 
        tourist when visiting it.
